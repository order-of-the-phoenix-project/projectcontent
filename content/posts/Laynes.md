# Andrew's Opinion: Layne's really isn't that good

Sure, it sounds good. A box of chicken strips, french fries, toast, and that amazing Layne's sauce. But the sauce is about the only good thing. And maybe the variety of food you get for the price. Is it really worth it?

Layne's chicken is dry. You get juicier chicken from the frozen isle at Walmart. 

Layne's chicken is greasy. If your stomach can barely handle it, you know it's not good for you.

Their fries are the same generic kind you can get anywhere.

Their toast is nothing special.

The only thing really worth it is their sauce. Why not just buy the sauce itself and get better chicken elsewhere?

###### I agree with you Andrew. I have gone there at least two times and it wasn't that great.

###### This post offends me on a spiritual level. Though thick and thin, Laynes has been present to provide chicken that, while admittedly fails to stand out, serves as an ideal vessle for the ambrosia that is Laynes sauce. Sure, your body will implode as the sight of chicken slathered in a ketchup/mayo mixture, but for a brief moment, your cares will drift away, awash in a sea of salty goodness. Suffice to say, I do not agree with you Andrew.
