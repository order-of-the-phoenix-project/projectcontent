<h1>An Institution</h1>
<p>In a world of fast food representing poor imitations of food that could be, there stands a behemoth whom, atleast in the realm of bean and chesse tacos, not only produces food in a masterfully quick manner, but also captures the truest essence of what that food hopes to achieve. This is the true wonder of Taco Cabana. That a business, a corporate chain, could so effortlessly recreate such paramount tex-mex cuisine at countless locations with staggering consistency.</p>

<h1>Cheaper by the Dozen</h1>
<p>You might think that this incredible quality and speed would only be accessible to the most upper-class among us, but nay! Each taco you purchase comes at a marginal cost of just above a dollar, potentially cheapened even further when purchased in bulk!</p>

##### I agree with you. Taco Cabana has good quality and is cheap. You wouldn't be wrong if you want something fast, good, and cheap.

I will go for the margaritas!
