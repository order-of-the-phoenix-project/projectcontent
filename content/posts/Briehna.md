# Chiptole
![Chiptole1] 
Chipotle is a Mexican Grill fast-food restruant. Chiptole serves salads, burrritos, bowls, and tacos. You have the choice to build your own with different choose meats, rices, and beans, and sides like corn, sauces, sourcream, and etc. You have the choice of add-ons such as guacolmole and chips on the side for an extra charge. Chiptole is more expensive. They don't have as many deals as Freebirds does on Hooked but the quality of the food is better. Everytime I go back home to Houston, I go to Chiptole at least 2x. 

##### Chiptole is BETTER!
