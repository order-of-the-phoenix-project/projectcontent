# Chiptole

Chiptole is better than Freebirds to me. Chiptole is more expensive. They don't have many deals like Freebirds does on Hooked. Everytime I go back home to Houston, I go to Chiptole at least 2x. Chipotle is a Tex-Mex fast-food restruant. Chiptole serves salads, burrritos, bowls, and tacos. You have the choice to build your own with different meats, choose of beans, and sides (add-ons) like corn, sauces, sourcream, and etc.
