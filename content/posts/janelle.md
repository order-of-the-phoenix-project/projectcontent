### Reviews
##### Justin F of College Station on Yelp said: 
###### Ordered the heavyweight (1/2 lb) burger combo with cheese and it was delicious!  Burger was bigger than I expected and the curly fries were perfection. The service I received was very accommodating and friendly. I highly recommend Fat Burger for anyone wanting a delicious burger for a great price!
